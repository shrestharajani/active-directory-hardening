# 🛡️ Active Directory Setup & Security Hardening

## 📌 Overview
Configured and secured a Windows Server 2019 domain environment with hardened Group Policies.
This project demonstrates the secure deployment, configuration, and hardening of an enterprise-grade **Active Directory (AD)** infrastructure using Windows Server 2019. The environment included a Domain Controller, File Server, and Client Machine, and was evaluated against **CIS Benchmarks** and **PingCastle** assessments for improved security posture.

> 💼 **Project Type**: Academic Group Project  
> 👩‍💻 **My Contribution**: Led the entire AD setup, user/group configuration, and implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Participated in all phases of testing, documentation, and hardening.
